    "[Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) is an affordable tool for obtaining cloud compute power. Using it, you can run jupyter notebooks, python scripts, or just about anything, provided you can write the right Docker file. Plus some of the compute instances also come with GPUs, making Paperspace an alternative to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). In contrast with Google Colab though, Paperspace saves the files you use, so they are there when you return. Inspired by Alex's post on [Building my own image to use IceVision with Paperspace](https://mlops.systems/tools/docker/computervision/2022/03/25/paperspace-docker-icevision.html), in this post I'll describe how you can build a docker image to wrap an Anaconda environment, and then run it on Paperspace. The Dockerfile and Anaconda environment I used are available on Github [here](https://github.com/krishanr/paperspaceconda).\n",
    "\n",
    "The context for this post is that even though a custom anaconda environment can be created and run in the Paperspace images that are readily available, for longer projects, it would be useful to use a Paperspace image that comes prebuilt with a desired environment."
