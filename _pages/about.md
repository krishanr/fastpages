My name is Krishan Rajaratnam and I'm data scientist and mathematician. I've always had a strong interest in mathematics, science, and technology, and I'm able to combine many of these interests in a career applying machine learning.

I finished my PhD at the University of Toronto under [Professor Israel Michael Sigal](https://www.math.toronto.edu/sigal/) studying the mathematical theory behind the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (thesis available [here](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/95954/3/Rajaratnam_Krishan_201906_PhD_thesis.pdf)). I also did a Master's thesis at the University of Waterloo under [Professor Dong Eui Chang](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/node) and [Professor Raymond G. McLenaghan](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/people-profiles/raymond-g-mclenaghan) studying and developing the mathematical theory behind the orthogonal separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation on spaces of constant curvature (thesis available [here](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/8350)).

Besides my technical interests, I generally have a growth mindset and am interested in staying fit, with hobbies like biking, running, and weight lifting.
