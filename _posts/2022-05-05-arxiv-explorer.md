<p>The <a href="https://arxiv-explore.herokuapp.com/">arXiv Explorer</a> is an application designed to give the user a high level view of important trends in the arXiv{% fn 1 %}. Specifically, it shows a heatmap of influential preprints on all of arXiv, or any subcategory, with the click of a button. For any subcategory of the arXiv, like Information Theory, it shows you the top 3 most cited preprints for each year of the subcategory.</p>
<p>practical use case of this app is for aspiring STEM researchers that want to choose a thriving research area for future study, or find influential preprints in their area.</p>

<p>Here's an example of a heroku app I've built for viewing influential preprints on the arxiv. It allows you to view a heatmap of influential preprints on all of arxiv, or any subcategory, with the click of a button. Specifically, for any subcategory of the arxiv, it shows you the top 3 most cited preprints for each year of the subcategory.

<h2 id="Technical-details">Technical details<a class="anchor-link" href="#Technical-details"> </a></h2><p>In addition to giving you a nice birds eye view of the arxiv, much better than what's available here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/">https://arxiv.org/</a>, there were also some technical challenges that had to be overcome to build it. The original arxiv dataset was several gigabytes in size, but the memory limit on heroku was only 500 megabytes. Thus the heroku app uses a preprocessed version of the original dataset containing summary statistics used in the visualization. Some of the summary statistics are less accurate than that which can be obtained with the full dataset, but a reasonable trade off was made for the visualization.</p>
