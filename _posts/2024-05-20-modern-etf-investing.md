<p>According to the above figure, over the 53 year period from 1970 to 2023, the S&amp;P 500 grew an average of 10.75% per year, whereas cash grew an average of 4.35% per year. 
The cash growth just beat inflation, which was 3.98% per year during that period. Here "Cash" is measured in the value of 3-month U.S. T-Bills. It's well known that leaving money
in actual cash loses value over time, because prices of common items like bread, and soap and tend to increase over time.</p>
<p>Why is this useful to the average person? At an annual growth rate of 10.75%, an initial saving of \$1000 plus monthly investments of \\$400 per month can grow to \$1 million dollars in 30 years. You can do the calculation yourself <a href="https://www.dinkytown.net/java/savings-calculator-canadian.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to get good returns, similar to 10.75%, is to invest in mutual funds, which invest your money in a variety of financial products, including stocks and bonds. They often claim to give great returns, even better than the S&amp;P 500 (which is unlikely to hold for 20-30 years, see {% cite hallam2017millionaire %} for example). However they come at a large cost, measured by the management expense ratio (MER). The MER is a percentage that is deducted from the annual returns of the underlying portfolio. This <a href="https://learningtofi.com/mer-fee-calculator/">MER calculator</a> comapres an initial investment of \$10000 with monthly contributions of \\$1000 over 25 years
with investments that have the same return but significantly different MERs. The first investment has an MER of 0.24%, comparable to many Vanguard funds, and the second has an MER of 2.23%, the MER of expensive mutual funds. The difference in fees over 25 years is over \$225 thousand dollars.</p>
<p>The solution for most people is to inveset in index funds. Index funds are designed to passively track an index like the S&amp;P 500 US stock market index, S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index, bond market indices, etc. Since they are passively managed, they typically have a much lower MER than mutual funds, which are actively managed. Most brokerages sell exchange traded funds (ETFs), which are index funds that can be traded like stocks.</p>
<p>With thousands of ETFs to choose from these days, there are still challenges. The solution is to pick ETFs with low fees (MER &lt; 0.5%), a diversified portfolio, and be consistient over the long run (quoted from <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/">canadiancouchpotato.com</a>). <a href="https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/home">Vanguard</a> ETFs are a great choice for having well diversified ETFs with low fees, which I go with. There's also BlackRock (iShares) and BMO in Canada. Simple examples of balanced (containing stocks and bonds) ETF portfolios are available <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/">here</a>. For example, <a href="https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/products/products-group/etfs/VBAL">VBAL</a> is an ETF by Vangaurd Canada that has been around since 2018 and has a 5 year growth rate of 6.30%, with an MER of 0.24%, thus an effective 5 year growth rate of 7.4%. This ETF is an "end-user" ETF that tracks an internal benchmark, but claims to "invest in broad-based equity and fixed income markets", so it's safe to assume it's diversified. See the top 10 holdings for the specific ETFs it aggregates. This ETF gives a fairly easy option for a low fee, diversified portfolio.</p>
<p>Finally a plan to practically implement ETF investing by automatically investing deposits, and reinvesting dividends can be found at {% cite canadiancouchpotato %} <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/2020/01/28/how-to-set-up-a-hands-off-etf-portfolio/">here</a>.
